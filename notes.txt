Goal: run PCA on entire directory
	-Directory contains .csv files
	-Open each file individually, create windows/features
	-Stack imported data sets (rather than concatenating csv files)
	-Run PCA on master dataset

Bring whiteboard


Step 1:
python executable...
`python pca.py ./csv_directory`

Iterate over each csv:
        make windows, feature set
Combine datasets
        stack feature engineered data set
Run PCA on combined dataset

receive arguments:
arg is directory
    for each csv file in directory...
        feature set
        return dataset_i



I need to automate the importing, and feature engineering.
Module that imports, transforms, returns feature set.

Module that combines feature sets.

Module that runs PCA
