Current goal: feature engineering. Simple classification between walk/not walk to determine which features are most valid.

look into partial amplitudes in fft

To that end, anticipated work flow is as follows:
   import raw
   Binning
      fft transform 
      dominant freqs and coeffs
      weighted average of bin
      average magnitudes of 3 inputs
      max amplitude (calculated from raw)

   ...
   Shape of input is 2D, so (45, 3000) is acceptable

Benefits/drawbacks to binning vs windows

What is kullback-leibler divergence?
     Kullback-Leibler divergence computes the loss of information between the full frequency signal and the reduced frequency signal.

kld(Fk, freq, Fk_red, f_red) returns entropy between the sets. Closer to 0 = better.


Complex numbers in frequencies - can always be reduced to abs(freq), with no regard to lost information.


Let's start by reducing freqencies, and testing for loss.
Bin data, perform kullbeck-leibler, reconstruct time series with primary frequencies
