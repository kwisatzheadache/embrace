Features of window: max amplitude, avg, min
frequency domain - (freq coeff) max frequ coeff

modularize functions
define functions first


Accelerometer Magnitude of signal... subtract 9.8 for gravity

Calculate magnitude of signal, then subtract 9.8

Keep only the top 20% of frequencies for example. Otpimize for best fit.

Question: whether to have windows as dataframes or np.arrays?


when lagging set and creating windows, make sure that after all windows are created, they are the same size after NAN's are trimmed. Or make sure that varying size is not a problem.


look into partial amplitudes in fft

Questions for 11/03

What is bin sizing, how does it work? Different from top freq?
error in embrace_fft.py line 100 division by 0

Is it better to have 4d input (9,31000, 2,10) or something more like (30, 30000)?

Magnitude of raw data?


Draw out basic data flow and structure. Sit down and map out transforms, etc.
