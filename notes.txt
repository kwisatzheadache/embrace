Current goal: feature engineering. Simple classification between walk/not walk to determine which features are most valid.
To that end, anticipated work flow is as follows:
   import raw
   Binning
      fft transform 
      dominant freqs and coeffs
      weighted average of bin
      average magnitudes of 3 inputs
      max amplitude (calculated from raw)

   ...
   Shape of input is 2D, so (45, 3000) is acceptable

Benefits/drawbacks to binning vs windows

What is kullback-leibler divergence?
     Kullback-Leibler divergence computes the loss of information between the full frequency signal and the reduced frequency signal.

kld(Fk, freq, Fk_red, f_red) returns entropy between the sets. Closer to 0 = better.


Complex numbers in frequencies - can always be reduced to abs(freq), with no regard to lost information.

look into partial amplitudes in fft



Draw out basic data flow and structure. Sit down and map out transforms, etc.
