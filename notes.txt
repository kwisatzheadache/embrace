Features of window: max amplitude, avg, min
frequency domain - (freq coeff) max frequ coeff

modularize functions
define functions first


Accelerometer Magnitude of signal... subtract 9.8 for gravity

Calculate magnitude of signal, then subtract 9.8

Keep only the top 20% of frequencies for example. Otpimize for best fit.

Question: whether to have windows as dataframes or np.arrays?


when lagging set and creating windows, make sure that after all windows are created, they are the same size after NAN's are trimmed. Or make sure that varying size is not a problem.


look into partial amplitudes in fft
