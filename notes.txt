Current goal: feature engineering. Simple classification between walk/not walk to determine which features are most valid.
To that end, anticipated work flow is as follows:
   import raw
   Binning
      fft transform 
      dominant freqs and coeffs
      weighted average of bin
      average magnitudes of 3 inputs
      max amplitude (calculated from raw)
   ...
   Shape of input is 2D, so (45, 3000) is acceptable

Benefits/drawbacks to binning vs windows

look into partial amplitudes in fft



Draw out basic data flow and structure. Sit down and map out transforms, etc.
