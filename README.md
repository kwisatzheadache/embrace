`functions.py` includes current data tranformation functions, primary of which is the fourier transform.

Current tasks:
Label all sets and combine to train a classification model (non-binary).
Test model on random sequence. 
Optimize model for performance on random sequence.


I'm running into an error in the `extract.py` portion. It is supposed to generate dominant freqency lists. Which it does. But then it starts throwing an indexing error around random_sequence[0:6286] or so.
