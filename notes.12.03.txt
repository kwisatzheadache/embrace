Extraction first and foremost


move to demo with longitudinal tracking
no classifiers
autocorrelation to detet walk cycles
metric calculations from walk cycles

demo - patient comes in walks
demo shows walks, along with comparison to previous walks, 
in a graph

need to pull from database.... 


Code that needs to be wrrite
walk cycle detection w/ autocorrelation
more periodicity for walk than anything else
step frequency, stride lenghth estimated from there

walk cycle extraction

metrics
stride frequency 
symmetry 
stride length


First:
walk cycle detection
lag
offest
multyiply
normalize

fft
multiply by complex conjugate
tranform back out


peak detection
space between
variance between peaks and autocorrelation intself


show that autocorrelation is periodic


output of auto-corr function on a window is a score of the quality of its periodicity
to use as indicator of walk-cycle/non-walk-cycle



Real number one:
find sections of data where rotation as determined by magnetometer is less than some threshold
to find relatively straight walk cycles
where magnitometer is fairly straight
threshold in degrees
